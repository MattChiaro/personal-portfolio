# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio website, written in HTML and CSS. It serves as a landing page for what I am currently up to in dev-land, as well as some of my favorite projects I have worked on thus far. 

If you need to contact me or reach out to me on any socials, this is the best place to find my most up to date contact information as well.

This webpage is fully scalable based on different media queries, so it will appear different on different sized viewports and devices. Examples are below.
