# Personal Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio website, written in HTML and CSS. It serves as a landing page for what I am currently up to in dev-land, as well as some of my favorite projects I have worked on thus far. 

If you need to contact me or reach out to me on any socials, this is the best place to find my most up to date contact information as well.



## Installation

Project is live at https://mattchiaro.github.io/personal-portfolio/

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:
